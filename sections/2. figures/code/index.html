        <p>No matter where you are on Earth, we all look up to the same sky during the dark nights. You might see a different section of it depending on your exact location, time & season, nevertheless the stars have fascinated humans across time and continents.</p>
        <p>Our own creativity combined with stories about local legends and myths have created a diverse set of different constellations. And even though the stars don't change, people have found many different shapes in the same sky. From humans, to animals, to objects, and even abstract concepts.</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Text Orion -->
    <section id="section-text-orion" class="section-text">
        <h2>The same sky, different figures</h2>
        <p>Let's compare 28 different <a href="#sky-cultures">"sky cultures"</a> to see differences and similarities in the shapes they've seen in the night sky. Ranging from the so-called "Modern" or <span class="western">Western</span> constellations, to <span class="chinese">Chinese</span>, <span class="maori">Maori</span> and even a few shapes from historical cultures such as the <span class="aztec">Aztecs</span>.</p>
        <p>Take the star <span class="red">Betelgeuse</span>. This red supergiant is one of the brightest stars in the night sky. In proper darkness, you can even <i>see</i> that it shines in a distinctly red color. It's part of one of the easiest to distinguish modern constellations known as <span class="red">Orion</span>, named after a gigantic, supernaturally strong hunter from Greek mythology.</p>

        <p>The visualization below shows how <span class="red">Betelgeuse</span> has been used by 17 cultures (out of the 28) to form constellations, each represented by a different color. The main shape of a <i>long rectangle that is "tightened by a belt" in the center</i> is clearly visible, with many lines of different constellations appearing side by side. These bright stars thus seem to form a distinctive figure. However, there are some fascinating alternates in there too; mostly humanoid shapes by the <span class="egyptian">Egyptians</span>, <span class="navajo">Navajo</span> and <span class="tupi">Tupi</span>.</p>
        <p class="chart-explanation-text">The separate constellation shapes of each culture can be found in a ring around the main circle. <span class="red">Click</span> on any of the smaller circles to make it appear in the center.

        <p class="no-top">However, if we instead focus on <b class="red string-click sirius-click">Sirius</b>, the brightest star in the night sky, no clear shape is shared across cultures. In <span class="western">Western</span> culture it belongs to <span class="red">Canis Major</span>, i.e. the Large Dog, and a dog shape can indeed be recognized. But other cultures have seen Sirius as part of an Eagle, Wolf and several more animals.</p>

        <p class="no-top">Perhaps the most universally recognized figure across all cultures is the first one that many people learn as a kid; the <span class="red">Big Dipper</span>. Roughly 17 out of the 20 constellations that use <b class="red string-click dubhe-click">Dubhe</b>, the top right star, share practically the same "cooking pan" shape. And even though the shapes are almost the same, the <i>actual figures</i> that were seen differ quite a lot.

        <h2>Brightness doesn't determine all</h2>
        <p>Let's look at all 2168 unique stars that are included in at least one constellation across all <a href="#sky-cultures">sky cultures</a>. The chart below shows the stars according to their brightness from left to right, and the number of constellations the star appears in from top to bottom. A general trend is visible: The brighter the star, the more constellations it's included in. This makes sense, since brighter stars just stand out more.</p>
        <p class="sidenote">Another thing that most likely plays a role is "good placement" around the ecliptic so it's visible in many regions of the Earth</p>
        <p>However, some stars stand out because they "rise" from the general mass; they are included in constellations more often than you'd expect based on their brightness. The main reason appears to be that they are often part of an easy to recognize "shape" of stars, such as <b class="red string-click betelgeuse-click">Orion's belt</b>, the <b class="red string-click atlas-click">Pleiades</b>, and the <b class="red string-click alphekka-click">Corona Borealis</b> and <b class="red string-click aldebaran-click">Taurus</b> constellations.</p>
        <p>And vice versa, several other stars are used less often than expected for their brightness. In these cases the star is often a bit of a loner. There is no group of close-by stars to form an easy to recognize shape with, such as <b class="red string-click sirius-click">Sirius</b> and <b class="red string-click canopus-click">Canopus</b> all the way on the right.</p>

        <p id="chart-stats-explanation-text"><b>NOTE</b> | Star colors, based on their actual visible colors, have been exaggerated/saturated for better visibility. The sizes of the stars are (not-linearly) scaled to the <i>actual brightness</i> of the stars (called absolute magnitude); how bright they would be if they were all placed the same distance from Earth. Because stars are all at widely different distances from the Earth, how bright a star appears to us is called the <i>apparent</i> magnitude.</p>
        <p class="sidenote"><span class="red">Sirius</span> is about 25 times more luminous than the Sun, but <span class="red">Canopus</span> is ~10,000 times more luminous!</p>
        <p id="chart-stats-explanation-text">Take Sirius, the brightest star, it appears almost twice as bright to us as Canopus, the next brightest star. However, compared to the other stars we see at night it's actually not exceptionally bright. The reason it appears so bright to <i>us</i>, is because it's one of our closest neighboring stars (at 8.6 light-years).</p>

        <h2>The endless sky, binding us together</h2>
        <p class="sidenote">The earliest written evidence for the existence of constellations comes from inscribed stones and clay writing tablets dating back to 3000 BC</p>
        <p>It is innately human to see and use the figures in the night sky. To dream, to tell stories, to navigate, and more. Some groups of relatively bright stars are so distinct that cultures from around the world, separated by vast oceans, have connected them into a constellation in almost the same way. It's our human imagination and cultural history that ascribes wildly different <span class="red">figures</span> and meaning to the shapes though. From kings, to legendary & important animals to mythical gods and beings.</p>
        <p>So the next time you're outside during a dark but nice warm summer night, lie down in a patch of fluffy grass, look up and imagine your own shapes & figures from the pinpricks of twinkling lights above. You'll probably end up recognizing more shapes than you would've thought.</p>
